-   **Static data** will be saved in text files (**array like** data structure), **dynamic data** (**user inputs**) will be saved in binary format
-   Using new lines to seperate different part (Readibility)
-   Different files for different modules, a main.c file to combine them
-   DO NOT TRY TO MAKE CONSOLE TEXT CENTERED (left aligned printed text is important)
